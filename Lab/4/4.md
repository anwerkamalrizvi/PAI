# Lab 04 Tasks
>1. Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle
is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a
maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10%
of the total fare.
>2. Create abstract base class "shape" that has abstract method "area". Inherit rectangle, triangle and
square class from shape class and provide implementation of "area" method for each derived
class. Finally print area of rectangle, triangle and square.
>3. Write a program in which a class named Account has private member variables named
account_no ,account_bal ,security_code. Use a public function to initialize the variables and print
all data.
>4. A university is deciding to upgrade its system. In order to upgrade, you need to implement the
following scenario: Note the following:
• The class student has a function that displays information about the student i.e. id and
name.
• Class marks is derived from class student and has a function that displays all the marks
obtained in the courses by the students. i.e. marks_algo, marks_dataScience,
marks_calculus.
• Class result is derived from class marks. This class has a function that calculates the total
marks and then calculates the average marks. It then displays both the total and the
average marks.
In the main function you are required to do the following:
• Create an object of the result class.
• Then display the student details, the marks obtained in each courses and the total and the
average marks.

>5. You are tasked with developing a software system to manage vehicle rentals for a car rental
company. The company offers different types of vehicles for rent, including cars, SUVs, and trucks.
Each vehicle has attributes like the make, model, rental price, and availability status.
• Design a class hierarchy to represent different types of vehicles (e.g., Car, SUV, Truck).
• Implement methods within each vehicle class to check availability, calculate the total
rental cost for a given period, and display vehicle details. Ensure that the availability
status changes when a vehicle is rented or returned.
• Create a class for managing rental reservations (e.g., RentalReservation) that connects a
customer to a rented vehicle. This class should include details like the rental start date,
end date, and the customer renting the vehicle.
• Design a customer class (e.g., Customer) to store information about renters, including
name, contact information, and rented vehicles. Implement a method to display a
customer's rental history.
• Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a function or method that can display the details
of any vehicle (Car, SUV, Truck) or rental reservation (RentalReservation).
• Incorporate encapsulation principles to protect sensitive information like rental prices
and customer contact details.

>6. Create a class called "Employee" with properties "name" and "salary". Add a method called
"calculateBonus" that calculates a bonus amount based on the employee's salary. Managers get a
bonus equal to 20% of their salary, while developers get a bonus equal to 10% of their salary.
Then, create two subclasses called "Manager" and "Developer" that inherit from the Employee
class. The Manager class should have a method called "hire" that logs a message indicating that
the manager is hiring someone, while the Developer class should have a method called
"writeCode" that logs a message indicating that the developer is writing code. Finally, create a
subclass called "SeniorManager" that inherits from the Manager class and that should have the
"calculateBonus" method to give senior managers a bonus equal to 30% of their salary.
